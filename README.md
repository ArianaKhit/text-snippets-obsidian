# Obsidian Text Snippets Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It allows you to replace text templates for faster typing, create your own snippets almost like in many text editors and IDE. 

You can use the shortcut (default `CTRL/CMD + Tab`) or the command `Run snippet replacement` by command palette (`CTRL/CMD + P`). The cursor need to be on the word you want to replace. You can replace text with spaces by selecting all the text.
